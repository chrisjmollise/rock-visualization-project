# Rock Visualization Project

## About
Developed with Unreal Engine 4.23

This project researches using Unreal Engine to create realistic photos and segementation masks for use in computer vision.

The project makes use of various technologies in order to create the visualizations. A main component of the project is creating realistic rock textures. This is done through the use of an Artec Spider 3D Scanner to get high detailed rock models and textures. These rock models are used in an Unreal blueprint that will randomly select a model to use and drop several rocks onto a tray. Using the High Resolution Screenshot command, pictures are taken of the rocks with both the realistic appearences and will the segementation mask.

Through this process, images can be created quickly without the need to manually set up a table with rocks and apply a segementation mask to the pictures.

This project is still a work in progress with work being done to increase the quality and realism of the rocks.
